    "To generate audio samples for the project, a utility script is used. This script is designed to automate the process of generating audio files. It utilizes the OpenAI API to convert text into speech. The script takes advantage of the `openai` module and requires an API key for authentication. The API key should be set up at OpenAI's platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the script's workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The script starts by defining the necessary variables, including the API key, the text to be converted into speech, and the file path for the generated audio file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `openai.Client` class is instantiated with the provided API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `openai.Client.audio.speech.create()` method is called to generate the speech audio. The method takes parameters such as the model to be used and the voice to be used for the speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The response from the API is iterated over and the audio data is written to the specified file path using the `open()` function.\n",
    "\n",
